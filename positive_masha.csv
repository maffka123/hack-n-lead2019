notrelated,Hours could be challenging for someone who is use to office job. But for someone who is up for a challenge on daily basis, this is the right place to be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Early days Late nights Difficult helpers Misplaced packages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Everybody have to work on the weekends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Located in a very old greenhouse on a huge property. Third generation is starting soon. We do not know what to expect. They have a real issue about violating non-compete agreements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,"The company preaches safety non stop yet the average employee works 10-12 hours a day. There's no overtime, obviously. Saturday work is also mandatory. So, if you've worked a 55 hour week, guess what? You get to work an extra day, for free. Company preaches safety non stop which isn't a bad thing until you realize it's to protect only them. If you're injured or involved in an accident, their first question is, ""what could have you done differently?"". Routing is also designed to keep you on the road as long as possible. Out of place stops are pathetically obvious. These are only a few reasons why drivers threatened to form a union over this past summer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Working with old equipment is challenging. Trucks break down every day. New routing system needs major improvements. I don't know how it is cost effective to drive in circles every day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Physically hard and long hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Because of the types of projects Parker gets involved with and that fact that they are pushing the envelope it's no 9-5. This place is for people who enjoy a challenge but like to work. Sometimes the work loads can get a bit overwhelming but the end results are very rewarding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Underpaid in regards to work that you end up doing. Lot's of physical work and sometimes long hours. I do not trust a lot of the chemicals we ended up working with. You're also not supposed to share how much you make with other employees. They said it was because it was none of their business, but it really seemed that there was worry about the discrepancy in what employees were being paid... Probably to avoid a union.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Total discrimination. Only white folks can get promoted, even if they do not have the qualifications for the job. Non Whites have to work the hardest with the longest hours and remain on the lowest pay scales. Non whites cannot expect a promotion. Promotions are only for whites.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,We are being outpaced by our value and premium competitors in the category, which has put a strain on our businesses and resulted in a complete restructure of how we find value ($) in our organization. While this is an exciting challenge to overcome, it is a challenge none-the-less, and company culture and morale are low as a result of cost cutting (lay-offs) and burn out (being over-worked). Senior management is not as visible as they should be in 'rallying the troops' to help boost positivity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,The same people are tasked with improvements continuously and accountability to other leaders has been low in the past.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,I did it one time and I had a really bad time, wasn't even able to finish. I picked the 72 dollar block, from 3 pm to 7 pm. 50 stops with about 65 packages. ( picked randomly) The GPS is not good ( like the apple GPS compared to google maps/ Waze) and you MUST use their GPS. AMAZON!, ITS ILLEGAL TO MAKE U TURNS IN NEW JERSEY! So please fix that glitch in the app, asking to make U turns. ( the app will ask you to make 15 U turns a day... SIGH) In my first delivery and only delivery I had wrong address (2 places I had to call for supp, and you will be on the phone with supp for an average of 8-12 minutes to get one issue fixed! ( kinda long when you're out delivering and trying to make ends meet in a timely manner.) Issues with parking were defiantly present . (jersey city area) lets take a look, Amazon averages 18.00 dollars an hour for 12 packages to be delivered WITH travel time. meaning if you take 12/18.00 = 1.50 PER DELIVERY with 20-45 min to get to your destination. Not counting the cost of car insurance, gas, wear and tear in your car (opening and closing doors and cardboard box fragments left in the car after you're finished with your block). Possibilities for risks with getting a traffic ticket/parking tickets, minor accidents. NOT worth unless you get a route in your neighborhood. ( but you cant do that because amazon is not even sure where you're going until the very last second.) As my first time I had NO TRAINING at all. (AMAZON, watching 19 videos a week before my first delivery is not THAT helpful, I kinda forgot some of the stuff). When I got to the hub, I was told to put on a vest, show my ID and ask a bold guy for a route. THAT WAS IT. so I did that and he told me to load up the packages and go! (Moonachie NJ) so I did that, but I was not aware that the packages had a certain order to start and stop number on it ( to help you synchronize your delivery) ,I was not informed about this, found out AFTER the delivery was over. I had no idea in how to use the app because the things that need understanding ( the inter something) ONLY shows up when you are delivering, All this means is that I had to search threw ALL the packages in EVERY delivery.....SIGH!!! One other issue that I experienced with the app, was the description of the packages. The app would say the size of the package, (as in small, med, large) but the actual size of compared to other packages was way off, and it happened often. Out of 50 packages it must of gotten it wrong 20/50 size items. AMAZON, instead telling us the of size package just tell us the the dimensions in inches because it would be accurate description and it makes the experience better. If you so some crazy reason decide to join flex, please try to go with someone with experience first so you can see hows it works, OR get the smallest block possible. Because of Amazons lack or training is frustrating. Amazon def needs to improve their conditions to make it more worth while for drivers. well I hope my experience helps you guys out, goo luck out there!
notrelated,The place is better renamed 'Amazon Romania', the Romanians has dominated and being favored against other nationalities. Shift can be cancelled anytime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,The app itself is awful If you're late you miss your block You never know where your route is until you get there Trying to find a customer can be a challenge If you can't deliver a package you have to bring it all the way back to the warehouse You never know how many miles you'll be driving that day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,There is very little support for conference travel. The college admin is, well, a college admin. There's also the way the profession thinks about cc professors - if you care about that this might not be a good choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,It feels like the entire university system is chronically underfunded, attempts to secure funding are poorly managed, and any existing funding is misappropriated. The CUNY system is large and segmented, but even within individual colleges, the bureaucracy prevents progress on even minor issues and limits accountability. They are in desperate need of an outside management consulting firm because they are wasting federal, state, and municipal tax dollars on extremely inefficient, frustrating, and dated practices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,You are treated like dirt, you are cleaning dirt, you get covered in dirt. I have never worked for a company that cares so little for its staff. Even those who have given 30 years loyal service got pushed out without even a second thought. You are dealing with chemicals all day that are hazardous to health without adequate PPE. You are pressured to bring in sales but not rewarded or thanked when you do. I was once involved in a crash at work that disabled my van and gave me serious whiplash, when I phoned the office to report this thier first response was .... Did you get all your work done? I wasn't even asked if I was ok. Manager cooks the books at everyone else's expense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,depressing enviorenment that is a nightmare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Create a rotating on call schedule, don’t keep wages secret, and push your hard workers for raises,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Dangerous job, hazardous chemicals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Don't apply if you cannot multitask, if your day absolutely MUST be structured, or if you are not a self motivated, career oriented person. This environment isn't for everyone, and if you need coddling, you may be pressured beyond your comfort level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,The female manager is a grown women who acts like she's in high school. She acts nice and then talks about you negatively with her co-workers like you're not there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Company headquarter staff is awful to deal with. No urgency to assist with mandatory bid paperwork and will constantly find a reason to withhold/reduce bonus or commissions earned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,late hours, limited vacation time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Low pay, poor managing skill, uncomfortable place to work, no proper training, poor treatment to employees, laboratory is in a horrible condition and a mess everywhere. A lot of the employees are unhappy and it's kind of embarrassing for me to even say I work there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,No money to be made..no base pay all commission..for promoting the company..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Office is in a crappy area, parking is a problem. Could work harder on providing customers with better technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Insanely expensive poor quality health insurance, integrity issues with some employees, not enough training.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Installers are struggling to provide for their families. They cannot provide steady work. Stay away!! Gold medal is no longer the place to be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Worked there for over two years and dealt with terrible management from begining to end. No guidance from management most of them have no knowledge of the Feild they are in charge of.. so many communication issues between departments. Always behind schedule very disorganized and you get no support form any team members. Extremely frustrating place to work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,no communication between depts. scheduling issues. dispatch issues. no follow up with complaints. abuse of system. management leaves early leaving us with no support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,unprofessional environment, no respect for employees, not a good place to work, it's a plumbing company so do not expect professionalism, no room for growth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Work weekend and holidays,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,I regret not coming to work here sooner :). Honestly, I cannot think of any cons. If I was forced to, I would say we may appear to too big to have core values or integrity. Nothing could be farther than the truth. The owners are more engaged than many smaller company owners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Designers are overwhelmed with multiple projects with a short time frame to complete each project - Can be overworked and understaffed - Not many mentors; must seek external opertunities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,General sense that the culture has becoming increasingly corporate, with productivity targets, and a sense that staff are disposable and replaceable. Little effort made to retain staff. Attendings receive less generous benefits than at comparable academic institutions such as time off for CMEs outside of existing vacation days. Institution is risk averse and quick to throw people under the bus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,After the company began reorganizing the culture really began to degrade. Many of the people who were promoted were wildly unqualified and ill suited to their new roles. Many of the people who were demoted were the long-time coworkers that had the institutional knowledge that made the place run.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Over worked, under staffed, old, broken equipments and few hand washing areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,They pretend to be Christian based company but a lot of people who work there are very rude. My manager was horrible. He walks around without speaking and just sits on his butt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,From the standard of staff employed to the management. Nepotism and favouritism reigned supreme. If you’re White, you’re automatically seen as better. Racist store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,You'll need to grow some thick skin because customers aren't always the nicest to deal with as people are sometimes. Its very rare to get full time roles. And sometimes it feels like you won't get anywhere unless your brown nosing the right person. And you can say good bye to your weekends and social life because trying to swap a weekend shift is like trading in gold dust and you can't book days off unless you have holidays left, that could just be with my manager because I've heard other managers not be so strict.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Awful staffing, overworked to death, burnt out, TERRIBLE manager, felt like I was not cared about or valued, one of my patients had cockroaches in his room, lazy staff members,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Some of the managers make it seem like they only notice when things are negative and you never get any feedback on the work you do day in and day out. There are issues with some staff members bulling others into giving them patient assignments that are less work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,It's a high pressure environment, not only because of acuity, but also because of staffing issues. The culture here is very political because of management-union relations. Experiences vary widely based on your unit. And ICUs seem to take priority for staffing, which is problematic if you don't actually work in an ICU.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Limited resources, crowded space, trouble dealing with what at times is an extremely abusive patient population,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,need of remodeling with apathetic HR representatives to say the least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,staff bullying goes on with support of management. Racially motivated bullying also goes unchecked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,very disorganized. Many services are just terrible. The department environmental service is horrid. The hospital is always dirty. Dietary is also bad, they always messed up the pts orders. There is also a lack of communication between the interdisciplinary teams. This sometimes causes pts care to be delayed, and therefore stay longer then needed. Medicals supplies are also always lacking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,The most unfriendly coworkers to work with, with god-like complex who look down on floor nurses. There is very little supportive system among the staff. Dog eat dog world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Poor management, dripping in systemic racism, difficulty for minorities to reach senior leadership positions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Spread way too thin, responsible for more than any individual can handle, medstar lacks ethical practices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Bad communication, lazy account managers and unqualified supervisors. The only way you can progress is by knowing someone in upper management.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,You’ll never ever get your week vacation because they’ll tell you, you don’t have it. They tell you they offer personal and sick leave but you’ll never know how much because they won’t post it on your paycheck. It’s just terrible. Management get plenty of vacation time too. I think they take everyone’s leave.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Low pay for the majority of workers, high turnover, poor benefits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,I never work for you allied universal so I don't have no challenge my challenges is work good under pressure don't never let no one see.me under pressure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Management completely disconnected from workers. More than half of the guards are undisciplined and lazy. Badly underpaid. Hours constantly, randomly change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Not enough oversight of sites, they need more surprise site inspections to keep those bad officers on their toes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,They offer little support to their employees. The company that they sent me to was a great company to work for though, so it balanced out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Management problems, high turnover, unwanted and unexpected overtime. Favoritism and racial bias from Hispanic managers upon others. It's a real challenge for some to relate with those from another culture than their own. Everyone wants to be dealt with in a kind and respectful manner. This takes a balance of empathy, sternness and fairness to all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Frequent errors with overtime pay. Operations managers are constantly changing, and sometimes send unqualified officers to client sites. There's not much room for career growth. I felt like my hard work and contributions were ignored by the company, and that my manager's attention was focused on other accounts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Low wages for most locations for the amount of work you have to do. Management doesn't care about you as a person and will use you until you are worn out. Certain Supervisor and managers play favorites.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Communication doesnt happen easily. You have to chase down pay on a regular basis. TERRIBLE BENEFITS.. No PTO, family health insurance cost more that you get paid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Office staff won't return your call but will blow your phone up to cover their hides. Families can make false accusations, but instead of investigating, they take the word of the client and leave their staff to dry. Never send the in-service emails to all of the staff in the field. Some clients treated us like nannies, instead of nurses (I have my own kids to watch). Benefits are poor and the pay is humbling for registered nurses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Individually great people, but the powers that be don't communicate with each other causing uncertainty among employees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Lack of interaction with corporate staff. I was strictly a staff augmentation with zero input or feedback to leadership.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,They were really slow to get out the materials when we changed health insurance companies, although they knew it was coming months in advance. They are also limited by their contract with the US Government in what they really know and what they can say.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Sometimes you are stretched too thin while juggling many projects with similar deadlines but it’s not constant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notrelated,Even in Gaithersburg location there is disparity between how you are treated and your stress level (and ultimately your satisfaction) based on your boss and department. There is sometimes red tape to get what you want between locations and/or between upper management and lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
