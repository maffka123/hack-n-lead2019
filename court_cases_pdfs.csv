" Toledo Man Sentenced to More than 10 Years in Prison for Juvenile Sex TraffickingTargeted News Service (USA) - May 26, 2012Section:  U.S. Executive BranchCLEVELAND, May 16 -- The U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio issued the following news release:Mark A. Fetter, 29, was sentenced to more than 10 years in federal prison, followed by 10 years of supervised release, after Fetter's conviction for juvenile sex trafficking, said Steven M. Dettelbach, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio.""This sentence should send a clear message to those who would seek to organize and profit from these horrific crimes,"" Dettelbach said. ""The Northwest Ohio Violent Crimes Against Children task force and our office are working together to combat human trafficking.""U.S. District Judge David A. Katz sentenced Fetter to 125 months.Judge Katz also sentenced Kamell Fetter, 27 and the brother of Mark A. Fetter, to two years in federal prison.He sentenced Blanche V. Triplett, 47 and mother of Mark and Kamell, to three years probation with four months in a halfway house, following their convictions in the same case for witness tampering and obstruction of justice.All three Fetter family members reside in Toledo, according to court records.Mark A. Fetter was also ordered to register as a sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (the Adam Walsh Act).In pleading guilty on October 17, 2011, Mark A. Fetter admitted that in August 2010, he had engaged in the sex trafficking of a 17-year-old victim, ""T.H.,"" from a motel in the Toledo area. After Fetter's arrest, he was prohibited from contacting or communicating with the victim: his brother and mother were later charged, and convicted, for facilitating and arranging contacts between Mark A. Fetter and T.H., in which T.H. was encouraged and directed not to cooperate with law enforcement.This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney James V. Moroney following an investigation by the Northwest Ohio Violent Crimes Against Children (NWOVCAC) Task Force. The Task Force, coordinated by the Toledo Resident Agency of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, brings together federal, state, and local resources to attack the sexual exploitation of children.TNS C-Santpan-Santpan 120526-3890350 71SantoshIndex terms:  U.S. Justice Dept.; Press ReleasesDateline:  CLEVELANDRecord:  3890350Copyright:  Copyright (c) 2012 Targeted News Service.

Information was collected from police and court records, prosecutors’ press releases, and reports in the media. During this period, there was one case of forced labor of a domestic worker and six cases of domestic sex trafficking. Many of the characteristics of the Rhode Island cases were consistent with other human trafficking cases in the United States. Discussions of key findings include (a) outcomes of a criminal case using a new human trafficking statute on fraud in foreign contracting and a civil suit, (b) how online prostitution ads are used to market victims to sex buyers using ethnicity of the victims and age and social standing of the sex buyers, and (c) how mothers of victims are involved in locating their daughters and making reports to the police that initiated investigations.Keywordscriminology, social sciences, court cases, law, women’s studies, sex and gender, sociology, crime, law, deviance, sociology of law, criminology and criminal justice, law and courts, legal studies, political science, criminal behaviorIntroductionThis article is an analysis of law enforcement identified cases of  human  trafficking  in  Rhode  Island  from  2009  to  2013.  It gives a summary overview of the Rhode Island cases and com-pares them with U.S. national statistics on human trafficking.The  analysis  in  this  article  uses  only  law  enforcement identified cases, making the findings about human traffick-ing operations precisely focused on legally defined human trafficking  (Wilson  &  Dalton,  2008).  Several  key  findings emerged  from  the  analysis  of  the  seven  human  trafficking cases. These findings reveal insights into human trafficking perpetrators and human trafficking operations. They include (a) the outcome of a federal criminal case of forced labor in which a new anti-trafficking statute was used, and the out-come of a civil suit involving the same case; (b) an analysis of the online prostitution advertisements, including how vic-tims were marketed to sex buyers using their ethnicity and how  sex  buyers  of  certain  ages  and  class  standing  were attracted by the advertisements; and (c) how victims’ moth-ers  were  involved  in  finding  their  daughters  and  making reports to the police that resulted in the arrests of the traffick-ers. This later finding introduces a previously undocumented phenomenon that calls for more research.MethodThe  federal  and  state  anti-human  trafficking  laws  provide definitions of human trafficking that can be used for research as  well  as  prosecution  of  traffickers.  For  many  years, researchers had to rely on their own definitions of trafficking or  make  their  own  evaluations  about  whether  the  research populations met the criteria of human trafficking victims or perpetrators.  This  analysis  relies  on  legal  definitions  of human trafficking and law enforcement identified cases.Definition of Crimes in Cases in This AnalysisThe cases used in this analysis are based on violations of fed-eral and state anti-human trafficking and trafficking-related laws. The federal anti-human trafficking law, the Trafficking Victims  Protection  Act  of  2000,  defines  a  severe  form  of human trafficking as the recruitment, harboring, transporta-tion, provision, or obtaining of a person for one of three pur-poses: (a) labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purposes of subjection to involuntary servi-tude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery; (b) a commercial sex act, through use of force, fraud, or coercion; or (c) a commer-cial sex act if the person is under 18 years of age (Trafficking 1Rhode Island College, Providence, USA2University of Rhode Island, Kingston, USACorresponding Author:Donna M.

The  federal  statute  used  in charges in the cases in this analysis is 18 U.S.C. 1591 Sex Trafficking of a Child or by Force, Fraud or Coercion.Another federal law that is closely related to the anti-traf-ficking law that is frequently used in federal prosecutions, but does not require proof of force, fraud, or coercion, is a “transportation  offense.”  This  crime  (18  U.S.C.  2421 Transportation  for  Illegal  Sexual  Activity  and  Related Crimes) is defined as knowingly transporting a person for the purpose of prostitution or any illegal sexual activity.The third federal charge in the cases used in this analysis is Fraud in Foreign Contracting (18 U.S.C. 1351). It is defined as knowingly recruiting, soliciting, or hiring a person outside the United States for purposes of employment in the United States by means of false pretenses or promises or fraud.After  the  new  federal  law  defined  human  trafficking passed in 2000, states in the United States followed with state anti-human trafficking laws that closely followed the federal definition of human trafficking. In 2009, Rhode Island passed a comprehensive human trafficking law: An Act Relating to Criminal Offenses (2009). It defined trafficking as whoever knowingly subjects, attempts to subject, or engages in a con-spiracy to subject another person for forced labor or commer-cial sexual activity using the following means: (a) causing or threatening to cause physical harm to any person; (b) physi-cally restraining or threatening to physically restrain another person; (c) abusing or threatening to abuse the law or legal process;  (d)  knowingly  destroying,  concealing,  removing, confiscating, or possessing without that person’s consent any actual or purported passport or other immigration document, or  any  other  actual  or  purported  government  identification document, of another person; or (e) by using intimidation (An Act Relating to Criminal Offenses, 2009).The  state  cases  of  sex  trafficking  used  in  this  analysis involve two statutes: Trafficking of Persons for Forced Labor or  Commercial  Sexual  Activity  (RI  11-67-3)  and  Sex Trafficking of Minor (RI 11-67-6).With established legal definitions and the prosecution of human trafficking cases, research can be done on precisely defined victims, traffickers, and trafficking operations.Sources of Data for This AnalysisA  recent  report  (Surtees,  2014)  evaluating  the  status  of research on human trafficking criticized the state of empiri-cal knowledge about human trafficking. It claimed that what was known about the perpetrators and the human trafficking operations  was  “rudimentary,  fragmentary  and  relatively meager.”  The  report  attributed  this  deficiency  to  many researchers  relying  on  victim  interviews,  and  using  their accounts to characterize human trafficking. The report rec-ommends looking for sources beyond victim interviews. In particular, the report calls for more research on human traf-ficking operations (Surtees, 2014). This analysis of human trafficking uses sources other than victims.This article analyzes law enforcement identified human trafficking cases in Rhode Island based on police and court records,  prosecutors’  press  releases,  and  reports  in  the media.  The  cases  are  law  enforcement  confirmed  human trafficking  case  which  are  cases  in  which  an  arrest  was made,  and  the  offender  charged  with  one  of  the  offenses listed in the previous section.Researchers identified cases of human trafficking in Rhode Island by searching in several places, including annual reports from the websites of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office, local news media archives and  websites  for  newspaper  articles,  and  videos  related  to arrests, convictions, and sentencing of human traffickers. The researchers verified the cases with the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office and the U.S. Attorney’s office.The  following  primary  documents  were  retrieved  from the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island and the  Superior  Court  of  Rhode  Island:  statements  by  police officers  and  witnesses  about  human  trafficking  crimes, indictments, plea agreements, and sentencing memoranda.In addition, press releases from the Rhode Island Attorney General’s  Office  and  the  U.S. Attorney’s  Office  were  col-lected. Statements in the press releases often added impor-tant information about the cases, such as historic precedents of the cases and the nature of the crimes. Media sources from newspapers, TV news, and blogs were used when they sup-plemented  the  information  from  the  primary  sources. Sometimes media sources were used as a reference when the information  was  not  available  in  official  documents.  An example of that kind of information is a quote made by law enforcement at a news conference about an arrest.Information from multiple sources was combined to cre-ate a detailed description of each case. Aspects of the cases were compared and analyzed to find differences and simi-larities among the cases. The findings from the Rhode Island cases were then compared with national statistics on human trafficking  cases.  Several  key  findings  from  the  cases  are discussed in detail.General Characteristics of the Human Trafficking Cases in Rhode IslandFrom 2009 until the end of 2013, there were seven cases of human trafficking in Rhode Island. During this period, there was one case of forced labor and six cases of sex trafficking.In many ways, the Rhode Island cases are similar to other human trafficking cases in the United States. In the words of Ambassador-at-Large  Luis  CdeBaca,  of  the  U.S.  State Department’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons:  “The  Rhode  Island  cases  are  symbolic  of  modern slavery” (Mulvaney, 2011c). According to data from federally funded  human  trafficking  task  forces  (2008-2010),  80%  of suspected incidents of human trafficking were sex trafficking, and 10% of incidents were forced labor (Banks & Kyckelhahn, 2011). The  Rhode  Island  human  trafficking  cases  followed  Skodmin et al. 3the same pattern, with six of the seven cases being sex traf-ficking and one case being forced labor.The one case of forced labor was a case of domestic ser-vitude.  The  perpetrator  was  a  foreign  national  from  the United  Arab  Emirates.  The  victim  was  a  foreign  national from the Philippines. The U.S. Attorney’s Office prosecuted this case. Following the criminal case, the victim filed a civil suit against the trafficker.Cases of Domestic Sex TraffickingAll  of  the  sex  trafficking  cases  were  domestic  trafficking cases, meaning the victims were U.S. citizens, and they were not transported across international borders. This pattern of victims  of  sex  trafficking  being  U.S.  citizens  is  consistent with  the  findings  of  the  Department  of  Justice  study  that found that 83% of victims of sex trafficking were U.S. citi-zens (Banks & Kyckelhahn, 2011). Furthermore, two of the cases were Rhode Island domestic trafficking cases, meaning both the trafficker and the victims were from Rhode Island and  the  victims  were  exploited  in  prostitution  in  the  small state of Rhode Island.Most of the sex trafficking cases involved interstate trans-portation  of  victims.  In  four  of  the  six  cases,  traffickers brought  the  victims  to  Rhode  Island  from  Massachusetts, New York, or Indiana. In one case of interstate transporta-tion, two traffickers from New York stated that they brought victims to Rhode Island because of the lack of a law against prostitution (Milkovits, 2010c). In one sex trafficking case, a male  trafficker  traveled  with  the  victims  to  Rhode  Island, while his female partner remained in Indiana and organized the advertising of the victims online (Neronha, 2010b).involved traffickers  bringing  minor  girls Victims of Sex TraffickingA  number  of  the  sex  trafficking  cases  involved  interstate transportation of victims. Two of the six cases of sex traffick-ing from Massachusetts to Rhode Island. Law enforcement personnel, service  providers,  and  researchers  have  known  for  a  long time that women and girls are trafficked from Massachusetts to  Rhode  Island.  Rhode  Island  strip  clubs  and  other  adult entertainment businesses were attractive places for traffick-ers to offer their victims to sex buyers because there was no law against indoor prostitution and no enforcement of exist-ing sex trafficking laws in Rhode Island before 2009.In the six cases of sex trafficking, there were eight perpe-trators and 11 victims identified in the cases. Of the 11 vic-tims of sex trafficking, all were women or teen girls. There was a wide age range among the victims. Six of the victims were  minors  (under  the  age  of  18)  and  five  of  the  victims were adults (age 18 or older). The youngest victim was 14 years old. The oldest victim was 45.Many service providers, law enforcement personnel, and researchers  have  recognized  that  runaways  are  frequently exploited  by  sex  traffickers  (Kotrla,  2010;  Shared  Hope International, 2009). The Rhode Island cases of sex traffick-ing fit this pattern. Five out of the six minor victims of sex trafficking were reported missing by their families or had run away  from  group  homes.  In  May  2014,  the  Rhode  Island Attorney  General’s  Office  said  that  it  had  a  dozen  active cases and was investigating another dozen. An agency that provides  services  to  victims  of  trafficking  said  that  it  was assisting 20 trafficking victims. The Rhode Island Department of  Children,  Youth  and  Families  said  that  in  the  last  year (2013-2014),  20  girls  (aged  13-16)  have  been  referred  to them by investigators (Milkovits, 2014c).The targeting of minor girls, especially girls in the child welfare system, by traffickers is widely recognized in Rhode Island  by  social  workers  and  professionals  in  the  juvenile justice system. In 2013, the Family Court of Rhode Island held  a  conference  on  sex  trafficking  of  minors  titled “Trafficking,  Trauma  and  Exploitation  of  Children  in  the Child Welfare System.”Some  of  the  sex  trafficking  cases  likely  involved  addi-tional perpetrators and victims who were not included in the official files. According to police records, in one state domes-tic trafficking case, “detectives have learned that [the accused trafficker] may have had six or seven young women or teens working for her, including another 14-year-old and a 16-year-old girl” (Milkovits, 2014c). In one federal interstate trans-portation  case,  the  traffickers  had  two  or  three  additional women working for them in and around the state of Indiana (Neronha, 2010a).Sex TraffickersRhode Island sex trafficking cases were consistent with the national  findings  on  whether  traffickers  worked  alone  or with a team. Of the eight sex traffickers involved in the six cases,  six  of  them  were  men,  and  two  were  women.  Two cases involved a team of two perpetrators. One of those cases involved two men working together, another case involved a man and a woman team. According to the data from federally funded  task  forces,  63%  of  incidents  of  sex  trafficking involved only one suspect, while 32% of incidents involved two to five suspects (Kyckelhahn, Beck, & Cohen, 2009).Prosecution of Sex Trafficking CasesMost of the cases of sex trafficking were prosecuted by the state Attorney  General’s  Office.  Of  the  six  sex  trafficking cases, four of them were state cases prosecuted by the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office, and two of them were fed-eral cases prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office. This dis-tribution  of  human  trafficking  cases  between  federal  and state  agencies  is  consistent  with  the  findings  of  the Department of Justice, which found that state agencies are more  likely  to  prosecute  sex  trafficking  cases  than  federal agencies and federal agencies are more likely to prosecute  4 SAGE Openforced labor cases (Banks & Kyckelhahn, 2011). In Rhode Island, although more of the sex trafficking cases have been prosecuted by the RI Attorney General, the U.S. Attorney’s office has been active in cooperating with local and state law enforcement on investigating sex trafficking cases. Most of the cases of human trafficking resulted in convictions. After prosecutions, seven of the eight sex traffickers were found guilty, and one case is still pending.Involvement of Sex Buyers in Sex Trafficking CasesThere were no sex buyers arrested in connection to any of the sex  trafficking  cases.  In  one  case  involving  a  14-year-old girl, the trafficker had sold the teen 45 to 50 times over a 30- to 45-day period (Rosciti, 2013a). When a reporter asked the officer in charge of the investigative services division if they were going to investigate the men who purchased sex from a 14-year-old  victim,  he  replied  that  they  “were  more  con-cerned  about  the  trafficker  than  the  actions  of  the  men involved” (Angers & Campbell, 2013). This comment raises concern about law enforcement personnel’s lack of interest in holding sex buyers accountable, as well as their lack of awareness of the harm that sex buyers do to victims.Overall, the general pattern and characteristics of the first human trafficking cases identified in Rhode Island were con-sistent with findings of other human trafficking cases around the United States.In the next sections, some of the key findings of the seven human trafficking cases will be discussed. Information that emerged  from  the  analysis  of  the  cases  resulted  in  some insightful  new  findings  about  human  trafficking  and  will point to new areas of research.Successful Civil Suit in Forced Labor CaseFrom  2009  to  2013,  there  was  only  one  law  enforcement identified  forced  labor  human  trafficking  case  in  Rhode Island.  It  was  the  first  case  of  forced  labor  prosecuted  in Rhode Island in modern history. The actions included a fed-erally  prosecuted  criminal  case  and  later  a  civil  suit  filed against  the  accused  trafficker  by  the  victim.  The  Federal criminal case and the civil suit had different outcomes.This forced labor case was the second time that the crime of fraud in foreign labor contracting (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1351) was used as it became an actionable offense with the passage of the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (The William Wilberforce Act). The first suc-cessful prosecution using this federal law was in 2010, when multiple  defendants  were  found  guilty  of  a  racketeering enterprise, involving forced labor and fraud in foreign labor contracting in Missouri. In this case, foreign workers were recruited  under  false  pretenses  and  forced  to  work  under threat  doing  housekeeping  in  hotels  (U.S.  Department  of Justice,  Civil  Rights  Division,  2010;  U.S.  Department  of Justice, Kansas City Division 2010).In the Rhode Island case, criminal charges were filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in 2011 (United States of America v.  Arif  Mohamed  Saeed  Mohamed  Al-Ali,  2011a).  The accused trafficker was a 46-year-old military officer from the United Arab Emirates, who was attending a program at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, on a student visa (Ballesteros, 2011).The accused trafficker brought the Filipina victim to the United  States  under  a  contract  that  she  would  care  for  his 5-year-old son. The domestic worker was supposed to work 40 hr each week, and be paid US$1,600 a month (Ballesteros, 2011). Instead, the accused trafficker forced her to work an average  of  119  hr  per  week.  He  and  his  wife  required  the victim to maintain a five-bedroom, three-story home, as well as care for the accused trafficker’s five children, cook three meals a day for the family, clean the house, launder and iron all of the family’s clothes, take out the trash, wash the cars, and clean the garage and yard (Ballesteros, 2011).The accused trafficker and his wife would not allow the victim  to  leave  the  house  unless  she  was  accompanied  by someone in the family. He seized her passport and told her not to run away because with the support of the U.S Navy he would find her (Ballesteros, 2011). While living in the United States,  the  accused  trafficker  was  making  US$32,000  a month (Mulvaney, 2011e). For the first 2½ months of work that the victim did, the trafficker sent a total of US$410.00 to her family in the Philippines as compensation for her labor (Ballesteros, 2011).Before the criminal trial began, the man and his family tried to flee the country. They were removed from a plane at JFK Airport by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. His wife and children were allowed to leave the country. The trafficker  was  released  on  a  US$100,000  bond  and  had  to wear a GPS tracker until he stood trial (Minute Entry, 2011a; Mulvaney, 2011d).The alleged trafficker elected to have a bench trial, mean-ing  that  the  judge  ruled  on  the  case  and  not  a  jury.  In  the criminal trial, there were complications resulting from poor translation  of  the  victim’s  testimony.  The  judge  dismissed the victim’s original testimony because the court interpreter used a different dialect than the witness and she admitted to not  translating  the  victim’s  testimony  verbatim  (Minute Entry,  2011b;  News  Staff,  2011). This  misinterpretation  of testimony led to confusion and conflict between the prosecu-tor  and  the  defense  about  whether  the  victim  should  be allowed to testify again. Ultimately, the judge ruled that the victim could testify again.At the conclusion of the trial, the judge decided to put more credence  in  the  defendant’s  version  of  events  based  on  his 30-year career in the Navy of the United Arab Emirates and the prestige  of  his  position  at  the  U.S.  Naval  War  College  (Lisi, 2011). The judge declared that the victim’s testimony “. . . doesn’t have a ring of truth,” and ruled that the accused trafficker was not guilty (Lisi, 2011; Mulvaney, 2011b; United States of America v. Arif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali, 2011b). Skodmin et al. 5Later, the victim, with the support of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), filed a civil suit  against  the  trafficker  (Elizabeth  Cabitla  Ballesteros  v. Arif  Mohamed  Saeed  Mohamed  Al-Ali  and  Samah Alharmoodi,  2011;  I.  Suriyopas,  personal  communication, April  1,  2015).  Three  of  the  charges  for  violation  of  civil rights were related to crimes of trafficking; they are forced labor, trafficking with respect to peonage, slavery, involun-tary  servitude,  or  forced  labor,  and  involuntary  servitude (Ballesteros, 2011).A  representative  of  the  AALDEF’s  Anti-Trafficking Initiative stated, “Our client was a recent immigrant with little knowledge of her rights” (Administrator, 2011). The trafficker took advantage of the victim’s unfamiliarity with employment laws and customs of the United States and used it as a means to maintain control over the victim and exploit her labor.The civil suit judge made a different judgment about the credibility of the victim’s testimony than the Federal judge. He recognized the control the trafficker had over the victim and the harm done to her. A representative of the AALDEF’s Anti-Trafficking Initiative said,Ms.  Ballesteros  finally  had  the  opportunity  to  give  unfettered testimony in a court of law. The judge said that the victim suffered “outrageous, illegal, and inhumane conduct” at the hands of the defendant. Her experience as an immigrant domestic worker is all too common, and we are committed to helping her recover and seek justice. (Sehgal, 2012)In contrast to the criminal court judge, who did not believe the victim was credible, the civil court judge did believe she was credible. The civil suit judge stated,This court, after hearing [the victim’s] testimony, and observing her demeanor on the witness stand, determines that [the victim] was  a  highly  credible  witness  .  .  .  her  testimony  about  the conditions of her employment and her treatment at the hands of the accused trafficker was compelling and believable. (Elizabeth Cabitla Ballesteros v. Arif Mohamed Saeed Mohamed Al-Ali and Samah Alharmoodi, 2012)The accused trafficker was ordered to pay the victim 1.2 million dollars in civil damages (Elizabeth Cabitla Ballesteros v.  Arif  Mohamed  Saeed  Mohamed  Al-Ali  and  Samah Alharmoodi, 2012). According to the AALDEF’s representa-tive, as of spring 2015, the accused trafficker has not paid the victim any of the 1.2 million dollars in damages. He fled the country and left behind no assets that could be confiscated (I. Suriyopas, personal communication, April 1, 2015).To date, there have been no summary reports about civil suits  for  human  trafficking  in  the  United  States.  A  recent report by Levy and Vandenberg (2014) described the “fail-ure” of criminal cases to obtain legally required restitution, although forced labor cases were more successful than sex trafficking cases. Between 2009 and 2012, the authors found that restitution was awarded in just 36% of the cases, and the amounts awarded were called “paltry” (Levy & Vandenberg, 2014). It is not known how much of the court ordered restitu-tion is actually paid to the victims.At this point, the outcomes of the criminal and civil cases on forced labor human trafficking in Rhode Island cannot be put in a national context. However, the difference in findings in the criminal case and the civil suit point to areas of interest for future research.The First Case of Sex TraffickingIn  2010,  one  year  after  the  passage  of  the  Rhode  Island human trafficking law, the first State case of human traffick-ing was identified. Two 23-year-old men from Yonkers, New York,  were  charged  using  the  2009  human  trafficking  law (Rhode  Island  Code  §  11-67-3;  State  of  Rhode  Island  v. Joseph  Defeis,  2011b;  State  of  Rhode  Island  v.  Andy Fakhoury, 2011b).The men brought women from their home neighborhood in Yonkers, New York, to Rhode Island in 2008 because, at that  time,  there  was  no  law  against  indoor  prostitution (Kilmartin, 2011). They pretended to be “gangsters” by giv-ing themselves the street nicknames of “Kash” and “Jemz,” and  made  rap  music  videos  of  themselves  driving  around Providence in a black SUV, flashing fistfuls of US$100 bills. In one video, they filmed a woman dancing on a stripper pole and rapped: “I keep a couple of hoes from around my way,” referring to the women they recruited from their neighbor-hood in New York (Milkovits, 2011).The two men recruited the victims through deception. One man  promised  a  19-year-old  victim  love,  friendship,  and  a waitressing job (Mulvaney, 2011c). According to the Assistant Attorney General, the men “preyed upon [the victims’] vul-nerabilities” (Mulvaney, 2011c).The Providence Police initiated an investigation into the sex  trafficking  operation  following  a  tip  from  police  in Yonkers,  New  York,  that  a  19-year-old  woman  was  being forced to engage in commercial sex acts (Milkovits, 2010a; Ruggiero, 2010). Police set up a sting operation, in which a law enforcement officer posed as a sex buyer by calling an online  prostitution  advertisement  known  to  be  associated with the victim. He arranged to meet the victim at an apart-ment. Upon his arrival, the traffickers were arrested and the victims were rescued (Ruggiero, 2010).After  being  arrested  and  charged  with  sex  trafficking, both perpetrators pleaded guilty to Trafficking of Persons for Forced Labor or Commercial Sexual Activity [RI 11-67-3] (Department of the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island, 2011; State of Rhode Island v. Andy Fakhoury, 2011; State of Rhode Island v. Joseph DeFeis, 2011a). The Rhode Island Attorney General described the senior partner in the trafficking operation as “. . . a manipulative, violent, danger-ous  predator  who  has  little  regard  for  basic  human  rights” (Kilmartin, 2011, press release). This man was sentenced to the maximum 20 years with 10 years to serve and 10 years  6 SAGE Opensuspended  with  probation  (Department  of  the  Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island, 2011; State of Rhode Island v. Andy Fakhoury, 2011). The second man was sen-tenced to 10 years with 1 year to serve and 9 years suspended with  probation  (State  of  Rhode  Island  v.  Joseph  DeFeis, 2011a).  Restitution  was  granted  to  one  victim  for  out  of pocket medical bills (State of Rhode Island v. Joseph DeFeis, 2011a). At  sentencing,  the  Superior  Court  Judge  said  that traffickers were guilty of “one of the most despicable crimes known to mankind.” The judge spoke as a Black man and made a comparison of the crimes of trafficking with slavery: “You can tell by the color of my skin I differ in complexion from you . . . People of my skin color, many of them were not brought here voluntarily . . . What you did in this matter is nothing less than being a slave owner in the United States of America” (Mulvaney, 2011a, p. A1).The first case of sex trafficking in Rhode Island showed the  connection  between  previously  decriminalized  indoor prostitution in Rhode Island and the sex trafficking of vic-tims to the state. As the first arrests and charge for sex traf-ficking, the proceedings garnered a lot of media coverage in the local media. The judge’s comment at sentencing clearly connected the actions of the traffickers to slavery.Federal Case of Interstate ProstitutionIn 2009, a report of an assault at a hotel in Rhode Island led to a federal investigation into an interstate prostitution opera-tion  that  stretched  from  Indiana  to  Rhode  Island  and Connecticut  (Bothelo,  2010;  United  States  of  America  v. Nathaniel G. Pope, 2009). The case involved two pimps—a 47-year-old  man  and  a  45-year-old  woman—from Indianapolis, Indiana, who exploited two victims on a road trip from the Midwest to the Northeast. They ran their inter-state prostitution operation for about 3 years, and had at least three additional victims in Indiana (Bothelo, 2010).The  female  pimp,  known  as  “Big  Mama,”  recruited  an 18-year-old  girl  from  Indiana  by  befriending  her  on  the Internet and acting as a friend and confidant (Neronha, 2010a; United States of America v. Jan Wales, 2010). The second vic-tim, a 45-year-old woman from Indiana was recruited by the male  pimp  in  an  online  “interracial  chat  room”  (Neronha, 2010a). The victim said that she was propositioned to be a prostitute for the pimp, at which time he “promised her that he doesn’t  beat  his  girls,  and  promised  her  that  she  would  be safe” (Bothelo, 2010).The  male  pimp,  known  as  “Rah,  Rah,”  transported  the two victims to New England while the female pimp stayed in Indiana and ran the administration of the prostitution ring. She  posted  online  prostitution  advertisements  and  set  up meetings  with  sex  buyers  (Neronha,  2011).  When  the 18-year-old victim did not want to engage in prostitution, the pimp threatened and assaulted the young woman. He stole her money, confiscated her cell phone, and abandoned her in a hotel room in Warwick, Rhode Island (Neronha, 2011).The  male  senior  partner  of  the  team  was  arrested  and charged  with  a  violation  of  federal  law  Transportation  in Interstate Commerce for Purposes of Prostitution (18 U.S.C. 2421). A few days later, the female junior partner, who had fled to Arizona, was apprehended (Neronha, 2010a).Both  traffickers  pleaded  guilty  to  transporting  victims across state lines for the purpose of prostitution (United States of America v. Jan M. Wales, 2010b; United States of America v.  Nathan  Pope,  2010).  During  the  sentencing  process,  the female pimp claimed that she had participated in a “victimless crime.” The United States Attorney said that she had know-ingly recruited women to engage in commercial sex acts and played a key role in organizing appointments with sex buyers. He said, “The defendant was a madam, not a victim” (Neronha, 2010a). “Big Mama,” the female pimp, was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release (United States of America v. Jan M. Wales, 2010a).During the sentencing process, the senior pimp, “Rah Rah,” said that his role was misunderstood, he was merely responsi-ble for “paying bills and getting groceries” in a “happy” home for wayward prostitutes and their artistic pimp. He too argued that  prostitution  was  a  victimless  crime.  The  U.S. Attorney responded that “this is not a victimless crime. It is tawdry, dan-gerous and degrading” (United States of America v. Nathan G. Pope, 2011). He was sentenced to 24 months in prison, and 3 years  of  supervised  release  (United  States  of  America  v. Nathan G. Pope, 2011).This case was the first federal prosecution of a trafficking-related crime after Rhode Island passed a law criminalizing prostitution,  which  enabled  the  offense  of  transportation across states lines for purpose of prostitution to be charged. The  claim  by  the  defendants  that  they  were  engaged  in  a “victimless crime” was clearly rejected by the prosecutor and the  evidence  in  this  case  demonstrated  the  violence  used against the victims in this interstate prostitution operation.Online Advertising of Sex Trafficking VictimsFrom  the  early  years  of  the  Internet,  traffickers  have  used online advertising to market victims to sex buyers (Farley, Franzblau,  &  Kennedy,  2014;  Hughes,  2001,  2002,  2004; Mitchell, Jones, Finkelhor, & Wolak, 2011). Sex traffickers’ use of online advertising has enabled them to reach a wider market of potential sex buyers, which has led to the growth of  prostitution  and  sex  trafficking  (Farley  et  al.,  2014; George,  2012).  In  addition,  sex  traffickers  utilize  social media on the Internet to contact vulnerable women and teens and groom them to be victims (George, 2012).This analysis of sex trafficking cases identified in Rhode Island  between  2009  and  2013  found  that  sex  traffickers relied  heavily  on  online  prostitution  advertising  sites  as  a means to connect with sex buyers. In each of the sex traf-ficking cases, traffickers paid for advertisements on online prostitution sites. Skodmin et al. 7Disguise of the VictimsThe  most  common  element  of  the  advertisements  was  the disguise of the victim’s age and identity. The traffickers used fake  names  and  false  ages  for  the  victims.  The  traffickers concealed their use of minor girls by always claiming they were above 18 years of age. The minor victims, who were aged  14  to  17,  were  advertised  as  being  19  or  older.  A 17-year-old  victim  in  a  Rhode  Island  domestic  trafficking case was advertised as being 20 (Rosciti, 2011a). A 14-year-old victim in a Rhode Island domestic trafficking case was advertised  as  being  an  adult  (Milkovits,  2013a;  Rosciti, 2013b). A  15-year-old  victim  in  a  Massachusetts  interstate trafficking case was advertised as being an adult (Kantorski, 2013).  A  17-year-old  victim  in  a  Massachusetts  interstate trafficking case was advertised as being 19 (Neronha, 2014).Sexually Explicit Photos of the VictimsThe  traffickers  often  photographed  victims  in  sexually explicit  poses.  In  one  case,  a  man  trafficked  a  17-year-old developmentally  delayed  victim  across  state  lines.  After being arrested, the trafficker admitted that during his online conversations  with  the  girl,  he  knew  that  there  was  some-thing not quite right with her and that she may have some mental  deficiencies  (Donaghy,  2013).  The  trafficker  took photos of her in her underwear standing in a hotel room, then posted them in an online advertisement (Steimle, 2013). In another case, the victim stated the trafficker took pictures of her on a couch when she was in her sister’s apartment before posting them online (Rosciti, 2011a).Means of Using the Internet in the Trafficking OperationDetails of the cases revealed how traffickers operate using the Internet. In an interstate transportation case, a man and a woman operated as a trafficking team (this case is described in  more  detail  previously  in  this  article).  The  female  traf-ficker  remained  in  Indiana  and  did  the  online  work.  She uploaded prostitution advertisements for the victims and set up a time and place for her male accomplice to deliver the victim to the sex buyer (Neronha, 2010b). The man in the team drove the victim across the Midwest and into the north-eastern  states,  including  Rhode  Island  (United  States  of America v. Nathan G. Pope and Jan M. Wales, 2010).After  posting  ads  for  the  women,  the  traffickers  trans-ported the victims to meet sex buyers, even when the victims were old enough to drive (Neronha, 2011). In three of the sex trafficking cases, the traffickers delivered the victims to the sex  buyers  in  hotel  rooms  or  apartments.  In  one  case,  the victim was instructed to walk to a nearby empty apartment to meet a sex buyer (Comella, 2011). In another case, the vic-tims were kept in an apartment with the two male traffickers and the sex buyers came to the apartment to use the women (Ruggiero, 2010). In another case, the sex trafficker took the teen victim to a strip club where she was used as an exotic dancer and used by sex buyers in the private booths in the club  (Kantorski,  2013).  One  female  trafficker  used  online prostitution  advertisements  to  set  up  between  45  and  50 meetings with sex buyers for a 14-year-old victim within a span of 30 to 45 days (Rosciti, 2013a). When the police con-fronted the 21-year-old trafficker, she said, “That’s [victim’s nickname], I knows she’s young, I don’t do anything, I just post info and take the calls” (Rosciti, 2013a).Exploitation of Race and Ethnicity of VictimsIn the advertisements, the traffickers exploited the victims’ race and ethnicity. The traffickers used the victims’ physical attributes to market them to sex buyers. For example, there is a small population of people from the Cape Verde islands in Rhode  Island  (Fox  Point  Cape  Verdean  Project,  n.d.).  The trafficker  exploited  the  17-year-old  Cape  Verdean  victim’s ethnicity in the prostitution advertisement. “Capverdian [sic] Paradise $50 Special—Hello, My name is Jessica . . . I am 20 years old and willing to make your night wild . . . hit me up if  u  down  to  handle  what  I  got”  (State  of  Rhode  Island  v. Brandon Frails, 2011).In another case, the trafficker emphasized that the victim was white with blond hair.A  pretty  and  petite  blond,  age  nineteen,  available  all  day  for upscale  gentlemen  looking  to  spend  some  time  together. (Ruggiero, 2010)Traffickers exploiting their victims’ ethnicity is not unique to Rhode Island. In a study of prostitution advertisements in Las Vegas, ethnicity was specified in 92% of the ads (Farley et al., 2014). The researcher wrote that the inclusion of race and  ethnicity  in  the  ads  reflected  their  importance  to  sex buyers.Targeted Marketing of VictimsThe traffickers also wrote the advertisements to target cer-tain  populations  of  sex  buyers  by  using  slang  or  different wording  and  language  style.  In  some  advertisements,  the traffickers marketed the victims to sex buyers of a certain age and economic background. In two of the advertisements, the traffickers targeted older, wealthier men. One advertise-ment  requested  “upscale  gentlemen”  (Ruggiero,  2010). Another trafficker requested that sex buyers be middle-aged or older “gentlemen.” “Sweet girl next door-19. Hey every-one! I’m the new girl in town. I am your sweet cute girl next door. So come see me. Older gentlemen only. 45 years of age and older” (Neronha, 2014).The  advertisements  listed  prices  for  the  commercial  sex acts. In one case, two traffickers sold the victim for US$150 for a half hour and US$250 for an hour of oral sex and intercourse  8 SAGE Openwith the victim (Ruggiero, 2010). And, in another case, a male and female trafficking team sold the victims to sex buyers for US$250 an hour of sexual intercourse (Neronha, 2010a). And in the case where the victim was a developmentally delayed teen,  the  trafficker  negotiated  a  price  with  a  sex  buyer  for US$40.00  and  two  packs  of  cigarettes  (Donaghy,  2013; Steimle, 2013).Law Enforcement’s Use of Prostitution Advertisements in InvestigationsIn  two  of  the  six  cases,  police  used  the  online  advertise-ments to set up a sting that resulted in the rescue of victims and the arrest of traffickers. In one case, after a call from a worried  mother,  the Yonkers,  New York,  police  identified the young woman in an online prostitution advertisement. They contacted Providence Police, who initiated an investi-gation into the report that a 19-year-old woman was being forced  into  prostitution  (Mulvaney,  2014).  Providence Police  located  the  online  prostitution  advertising  with  a photo  of  the  victim. A  police  officer,  posing  as  an  under-cover sex buyer, made an appointment to meet with the vic-tim (Ruggiero, 2010). The arranged meeting place was at an apartment in Providence where the victim was being held by the traffickers (Milkovits, 2010c).This analysis of online advertisements for victims of sex trafficking  is  consistent  with  findings  of  other  researchers, law  enforcement  personnel,  and  service  providers’  reports that online prostitution sites are commonly, even exclusively, used  to  market  victims  of  sex  trafficking.  Recently,  the Massachusetts Attorney General stated that the majority of sex traffickers in human trafficking cases prosecuted in her office have used online prostitution advertisements to exploit the  victims  (Healey,  2015;  Landergan,  2015).  Social  net-working  sites,  advertising  websites,  message  boards,  and dating sites all provide platforms for prostitution marketing with relative anonymity and impunity (Farley et al., 2014).Mothers Involved in Recovering VictimsOne of the key findings of this analysis of human trafficking cases in Rhode Island is that family members, particularly mothers, were often involved in the recovery of their daugh-ters. In half (three of six) of the sex trafficking cases, mothers played active, even central, roles in locating their daughters. Mothers  initiated  investigations  on  their  own,  made  police reports,  and  even  contacted  the  traffickers  in  attempts  to recover their daughters.The analysis of sex trafficking cases in Rhode Island found that some of the victims were not completely isolated from their families. Although the traffickers controlled the victims and  limited  or  monitored  their  communication,  the  victims were still able to communicate with family members. Several victims  in  two  cases  of  sex  trafficking  maintained  contact with their mothers using their cell phones. In these cases, the victims  talked  to  their  mothers  but  did  not  communicate openly with them about all the details of how they were being trafficked. One crucial piece of information they often did not reveal to their mothers was their locations.In  the  first  case  of  human  trafficking  prosecuted  in  the state of Rhode Island, two men conspired to gain the confi-dence of at least four victims from their old New York neigh-borhood  (Milkovits,  2010b).  The  traffickers  ensnared  the victims  with  false  promises  of  love,  a  job,  and  a  sense  of family.  They  used  the  victims’  familiarity  with  them  as neighbors to gain their trust (Milkovits, 2011). In this case, one  mother  knew  the  man  who  persuaded  her  daughter  to leave with him, although she did not know that he intended to exploit her (Milkovits, 2011).In the same case, one victim told her mother that she was leaving with the trafficker because he loved her, and he knew where there was a job for her as a waitress. Soon after the victim left, she called her mother and said, “Mom, I wish I’d never come” (Milkovits, 2011). Her mother’s suspicion that her daughter was in danger intensified when, over a period of months, her phone calls with her daughter were always inter-rupted. As the mother knew the man her daughter was with, she tried to contact him repeatedly to find her daughter. On one occasion, the trafficker answered his phone and told the victim’s mother that he did not know where her daughter was (Mulvaney, 2011a).Another  mother  in  the  same  case  was  not  aware  of  her daughter’s situation until she received a phone call for help from her daughter as she hid in a bathroom of the apartment where  she  was  being  held  captive  (Milkovits,  2014a). The mother called the police to get help for her daughter. When police showed up at the apartment, this victim left with the police. Another victim who was present denied that she was in  danger  and  stayed  at  the  apartment  with  the  trafficker (Milkovits, 2014a). She would not be rescued until months later when her mother contacted local Yonkers Police in New York for help to locate her daughter (Milkovits, 2011).As the victimization of teen girls and young women by traffickers becomes more widely known, more family mem-bers are turning to online prostitution sites to try to find their missing  daughters.  In  a  Rhode  Island  domestic  trafficking case, a mother recognized her missing 14-year-old daughter in  a  prostitution  advertisement.  Although  the  girl  kept  in touch with her mother every 2 to 3 days by cell phone, she never  disclosed  her  location  (Milkovits,  2013b). After  the mother  recognized  her  daughter,  she  called  the  number  on the  advertisement  and  confronted  the  trafficker.  The  traf-ficker hung up, but her daughter called her back and told her mother that she loved her. Still, the girl would not reveal her location. The mother then called the Pawtucket Police, which led  to  the  victim  being  rescued,  and  the  trafficker  being arrested (Milkovits, 2013b).In an interstate transportation case, a trafficker befriended a 17-year-old girl with a developmental disability online. He then met her at a public library in Massachusetts and took her  Skodmin et al. 9with him. When the victim’s mother could not find her daugh-ter,  she  immediately  called  the  police  and  reported  her  as missing (Hager, 2012). In the library’s surveillance video, the girl was seen leaving with a man (Saladna, 2013). The family participated in a press conference asking for the return of her daughter  and  asked  the  community  to  become  involved  in finding her. With tears in her eyes the mother pleaded to the man  who  abducted  her  daughter:  “Whoever  you  are  could you please just bring her home to us today. I want her to sleep in her own bed tonight” (Hager, 2012). As a result of the news conference and media attention on the abduction of the teen, the victim was identified by a Rhode Island citizen while she was with the trafficker on the street (Milkovits, 2014b).Two victims’ mothers spoke at the traffickers’ sentencing hearings about the harm that they did to their daughters. One mother  said,  “You  manipulated  a  very  trusting  young  girl. She trusted you and went with you” (Mulvaney, 2011a). She continued  by  stating  her  daughter  had  been  drugged, enslaved,  and  denied  food  and  water  (Mulvaney,  2011a). Another victim’s mother addressed the trafficker as she said, “You will do your time and get out and rebuild your life in no time,  for  my  daughter  it  will  probably  take  a  lifetime” (Mulvaney, 2011a).Although mothers played a significant role in locating and recovering their daughters, in one case, a family member—a sister—played a more complicit role in her sister’s victimiza-tion. She knowingly allowed her minor sister, who had run away from a group home, to have contact with a known pimp and  involve  her  in  prostitution.  After  the  trafficker  was arrested, the sister indicated that she knew the trafficker had “put her sister to work” (Silva, 2011). In a police statement, the victim’s sister wrote, “I . . . knew that [the trafficker] put girls on the Internet so he would have money in his pocket and gas in his car” (Rosciti, 2011b). She claimed that when she learned the trafficker was selling her sister on the Internet, she confronted him (Silva, 2011). However, a social worker from a group home was responsible for contacting the police and initiating an investigation, which eventually led to the arrest of the trafficker (Rosciti, 2011a).One  of  the  most  notable  findings  from  this  analysis  of cases  of  human  trafficking  in  Rhode  Island  is  the  role  that mothers  played  in  recovering  their  daughters.  The  police acknowledged the significant effort of the mothers. At the end of one case, a Sergeant from the Providence Police Department commended the mothers for their involvement in the case. He said the mothers kept looking for their daughters until they were found: “The mothers never gave up on their daughters” (Mulvaney, 2011a). The mother’s involvement was a key fac-tor in the discovery of these trafficking cases.Much  of  the  human  trafficking  literature  discusses  how victims are often runaway girls, who are fleeing abuse at home or throwaway girls who are no longer wanted by family mem-bers (Hanna, 2002). The analysis of these Rhode Island cases raises another possibility, and that is that mothers continue to look for their missing daughters and even take an active role in their recovery.There  are  anti-trafficking  organizations,  movies,  and books  that  emphasize  in  their  names  that  the  victims  are daughters.  Examples  include,  Captive  Daughters  (http://www.abolishsexslavery.org/captive-daughters),  Somebody’s Daughter  (Sher,  2013)  and  She’s  Somebody’s  Daughter (http://www.shessomebodysdaughter.org/).  In  England  in 1996, a mother, whose daughter was controlled by a pimp and murdered by a sex buyer, founded an organization called Coalition for the Removal of Pimping (CROP). The organi-zation  continues  today  under  the  name  of  Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation (PACE). PACE offers support to parents whose children are actively being sexually exploited by people outside the family, including traffickers.Before her death, Norma Hotaling, survivor and founder of SAGE  (Standing  Against  Global  Exploitation) in  San Francisco, said she wanted to work on family reunification for victim/survivors and their families, particularly between moth-ers and daughters. In her work with victims of prostitution and sex trafficking, Hotaling had discovered that often mothers still loved their daughters and were concerned about them, but their families had become broken, often due to domestic violence or drug abuse. Hotaling saw the possibility of rebuilding damaged relationships, and considered that an important way to assist victims to recover and find stability in their lives.However, there is no research on the continuing relation-ship between victims of sex trafficking and their mothers (or other relatives) after the daughter is under the control of a trafficker. The analysis for this article introduces this as an area for future research. Understanding continuing relation-ships between mothers and their victim daughters could pro-vide  insight  into  how  to  break  the  traumatic  bonding  that occurs between perpetrators and victims.ConclusionThis article is an analysis of law enforcement identified cases of human trafficking in Rhode Island from 2009 to 2013. It looked  at  and  evaluated  seven  cases  of  human  trafficking, including one case of forced labor of a domestic worker and six cases of sex trafficking.Although the number of cases in this analysis is low, sig-nificant information about human trafficking in Rhode Island emerged, including several topics for further research.Overall,  the  Rhode  Island  cases  were  similar  to  human trafficking  cases  in  other  states  in  the  United  States.  The forced  labor  case  involved  the  trafficking  of  a  foreign national woman by a foreign national trafficker. The sex traf-ficking  cases  were  domestic  sex  trafficking. A  few  of  the cases involved interstate transportation of victims, and there were cases that involved sex trafficking within the state of Rhode Island. The victims were often runaways who were vulnerable to recruitment by sex traffickers.Some  notable  findings  that  are  worthy  of  further  study emerged from the analysis. In the forced labor human traf-ficking case, there were different findings in the criminal and civil cases, which seemed to be a difference in the judges’  10 SAGE Openopinions on the credibility of the victim. To date, there has been no analysis of human trafficking civil suits in the United States. This is an important topic for further study, including the damages levied and whether the traffickers ever paid the damages to the victims.Due to a history of decriminalized prostitution in Rhode Island, traffickers perceived the state to be tolerant of prosti-tution and therefore a low-risk destination and environment for exploitation of victims. More research is needed on the role  that  state  toleration  of  prostitution  plays  in  creating  a low-risk environment for sex trafficking.Although the use of the Internet and prostitution advertis-ing sites have been researched, this analysis revealed a need for more detailed analysis of advertisements known to offer victims of trafficking, including the role race and ethnicity play in marketing the victims and the cues in the ads for the type of sex buyers the victims are being marketed to.Finally, the most previously un-researched topic to emerge from the analysis was the role that mothers played in locating their daughters and how their reports to police initiated inves-tigations. In two of the cases, the mothers contacted the traf-fickers in an effort to find their daughters. This is an entirely new area of research for understanding the dynamics of stop-ping human trafficking.Overall, this analysis of law enforcement identified cases of human trafficking in Rhode Island found that these seven cases were consistent with other cases in the United States. The detailed analysis of the cases revealed important topics for further research in this field.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Lucy Tillman (BA Communications and Gender and Women’s Studies, 2015, University of Rhode Island) for her team  work  in  collecting,  compiling,  and  discussing  the  data  that were used in this article and for her enthusiastic conference presen-tations.

" Servant was called an aunt, witness testifies Son's ex-wife says she notified federal authorities over woman kept in secretMilwaukee Journal Sentinel (WI) - May 19, 2006Author/Byline:  REID J. EPSTEIN, Staff, Milwaukee Journal SentinelEdition:  FinalSection:  A NewsPage:  01Almost as soon as she joined the family of Jefferson N. and Elnora Calimlim through marriage to their son Jack, Sherry Bantug was curious about the Filipino maid.At first, she testified Thursday, her husband told her that Irma Martinez was an aunt visiting from Chicago. Later, he conceded that she lived with the family in Brookfield but could say no more.Later, her marriage to Jack Calimlim crumbling, Bantug made the call to federal authorities that Martinez was no aunt — she was an illegal immigrant and cloistered servant in the wealthy family’s home.""I care about her,"" Bantug testified, describing the live-in maid of 19 years as missing out on her chance for a family of her own. ""She was afraid.""Martinez worked for the Calimlim family from July 1985 until she was removed from the house in Sept. 29, 2004, according to testimony. Martinez was kept away from the home’s guests.Less than two years into her time working for the Calimlims, Martinez wrote to her family in the Philippines to say she felt ""like a prisoner"" in the United States.In the letter, dated Feb. 21, 1987, and read in court, Martinez inquired about the price of a tractor she intended to buy for her father, asked if chocolate she sent for Christmas arrived and described herself as lonely. She also described what happened when the Calimlims took her out of the house.""If I’m out with them and they see another Filipino, they hide me,"" Martinez wrote. ""That’s why I feel like a prisoner.""Bantug, whose marriage to Jack Calimlim lasted 17 months, said she called authorities while the divorce was pending in the fall of 2004. By that time, she said, she had known that Martinez was living in the family’s home for nearly six years.Jefferson N. and Elnora Calimlim, both physicians and Filipino immigrants themselves, have pleaded not guilty to charges that they harbored an illegal immigrant for financial gain and engaged in forced labor. Their eldest son, Jefferson M. Calimlim, also is charged with harboring an illegal immigrant and making a false statement to a federal investigator.Prosecution restsThe prosecution finished its case Thursday, a day earlier than had been anticipated. The defense will ask U.S. District Judge Rudolph T. Randa to dismiss the Calimlims’ charges today, but barring a dismissal, attorneys will begin presenting the Calimlims’ case Wednesday.Bantug said that when she began dating Jack Calimlim, he told her that Martinez was the children’s aunt who lived in Chicago. There were no photographs of Martinez in the home, and Martinez entered and left the house only through a rear kitchen door that could not be seen from the street.""He initially told me that she does not live there,"" Bantug said. ""He later told me she does live there and he can’t say anything"" about the situation.Jefferson N. Calimlim initially was cool to Bantug’s idea to invite Martinez to Jack’s wedding. Testifying while fighting back tears, Bantug said she ultimately invited Martinez but had to keep the maid away from the family that employed her.""She sat with my aunt and uncle,"" Bantug said. ""I was told to seat her on the other side of the reception hall"" from the Calimlims.Bantug, who was married to Jack Calimlim from June 2003 to November 2004, testified that she went on vacations with the family to a lake home in Michigan four or five times. Martinez went along with the family on those vacations, where she helped with the cooking, Bantug said.Bantug testified that she tried to help Martinez and that she would call the family’s maid from time to time. On one occasion when the  Calimlims were not home, Bantug testified, she tried to take Martinez shopping, but when they got to the store, Martinez was too afraid to get out of the car.The Calimlims’ youngest child, daughter Christina Calimlim, referred to Martinez as ""Tita"" — the Filipino word for aunt — during her testimony.Asked whether there was a family rule against discussing Martinez to others, Christina Calimlim said: ""I don’t know. I guess you could say there was.""Christina Calimlim said Martinez did not accompany family members when they dined at restaurants. On occasions when they would attend the same church service, Martinez was not to sit in a pew near the family, she testified.Asked why Martinez was to sit away from the family for whom she worked for 16 hours a day, Christina Calimlim said, ""Because she was illegal.""Bantug said that when the Calimlims would entertain guests at their home, Martinez would work in the house, cleaning and preparing food, but disappeared before the first guest arrived. Martinez, Bantug said, was to stay in her bedroom until everyone left.Martinez did not receive her mail at the family’s Brookfield home but at a post office box listed under the name ""C.J. Jefferson,"" an amalgam of the Calimlim children’s names, said Christina Calimlim, who graduated from Brookfield Academy and the University of Notre Dame and now lives in San Francisco.Maid says she never saw moneyMartinez testified Thursday that she never saw the money she was to be paid by the Calimlims. Elnora Calimlim kept the money in a bank account she controlled, Martinez said. Martinez’s mother, Ceferina, later told jurors that she had to go through Elnora Calimlim’s mother to retrieve the funds her daughter sent home.Ceferina Martinez also testified that in 1985, she signed an affidavit saying her daughter was traveling to the United States with the Calimlims for medical treatment when she knew Irma Martinez would be working as a maid because the Calimlims told her to do so.The Calimlims paid Irma Martinez $1,200 a year for the first 10 years and $4,800 a year in the last nine, Irma Martinez testified. Gary Ray, an application director for the Utah Department of Workforce Services, testified that had the Calimlims paid Martinez a minimum wage fee for the hours she worked, they would have owed her from $19,041 to $29,273 for each full year she worked.Copyright 2006, Journal Sentinel Inc.

" Nevada Man Sentenced to Life in Prison on Charges Related to the Sex Trafficking of MinorsGovernment Press Releases (USA) - July 5, 2007WASHINGTON -- A Nevada man has been sentenced to life without parole in federal prison for transporting two minors across state lines to work as prostitutes after he previously had been convicted of a child exploitation crime, Assistant Attorney General Alice S. Fisher of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney George S. Cardona of the Central District of California announced today.Juan Rico Doss of Reno, Nev., received the mandatory sentence of life in prison yesterday from U.S. District Judge Stephen G. Larson of the Central District of California.On June 26, 2006, a jury in federal court in Riverside, Calif., determined that Doss was guilty of two counts of sex trafficking of children, three counts of transporting minors into prostitution, one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of children and transporting minors into prostitution, and two counts of witness tampering.The evidence at trial showed that during the first two weeks of May 2005, Doss conspired with his wife, Jacquay Quinn Ford, to transport two girls across state lines to work as prostitutes. Doss and Ford transported the victims -- one 14 and one 16 -- from Nevada to work as prostitutes in Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco and Oakland. Doss recruited and transported the 16-year-old victim by the use of force.At an earlier trial of Doss in April 2006, a mistrial was declared after the 14-year-old victim refused to testify against Doss. Investigators determined that Doss had coerced the victim and had convinced her to not testify, which led to the witness tampering counts in the second trial.""Juan Rico Doss stole the freedom of his young female victims when he recruited them and transported them across state lines for prostitution, sometimes through the use of force. Now he will spend the rest of his life in prison,"" said Assistant Attorney General Fisher. ""The life sentence in this case is the result of the cooperative effort of federal prosecutors, the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department, and is part of our ongoing effort to prevent and prosecute the sexual exploitation of child victims.""Prior to the first trial, Doss's wife pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy for her role in this offense and cooperated with the government. Ford testified against her husband at the second trial and was recently sentenced to 15 months in prison.Doss was sentenced to a mandatory statutory term of life in prison pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 3559(e), which calls for mandatory life imprisonment for repeated sex offenses against children. On Nov. 1, 2006, Judge Larson found that Doss's previous conviction in the State of Nevada on charges of pandering of minors for the purpose of prostitution qualified as a prior sex offense under this statute. Ford is one of the first in the nation to receive the mandatory life sentence pursuant to Section 3559(e).The case against Doss and Ford was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which received the case from the Los Angeles Police Department.
