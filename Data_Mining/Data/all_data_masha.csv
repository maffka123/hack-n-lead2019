171,Notrelated,Remote Tech Support is extremely lazy and clickish From the get go I was treated coldly and not as an asset to the company I was trained for an hour my first day just to answer phones and how to put notes on an order Thats it I wasnt taught how to do a ticket for an RMA or how to answer callbacks I was Customer Service but expected to take tech calls and sales calls Basically I wasnt trained at all Technicians were notorious for talking poorly about customers in employee chat not returning calls within 24 hours and lying to customers about packages being shipped out Techs if they had a problem with something you did rather than come to you privately they would put you on blast in the RTS chat since they had tenure and you were the new guy I brought all this to managements attention but I was ignored Management doesnt respond at all to customers unless absolutely necessary and only by email I had to take calls for the janitorial service for the HQ thats how much they dont answer the phones When you file a complaint against coworkers that have been tenure they go unheard but if the same coworker files a complaint against you Management listens without any proof even if you get a letter from the customer saying they DIDNT file a complaint against you I was promoted to Customer Service Manager solely to be a meat shield for upper management and then told to LIE to customers about their orders Digital Storm creates intentional product shortages to raise prices or if they have too much work and not enough people I told subordinates to do stuff as a Manager and Upper Management did nothing when I was told no by the employee But I get a performance review due to a complaint by the same employee Management would renege on agreements made with customers and would constantly violate their own Terms and Conditions It got so bad that when the Company offered complete rebuilds for customers I was skeptical so I had the customers take pictures of the serials of their parts before shipping machine back only to find out this Company used the SAME parts of a machine that was completely damaged in shipping by UPS and Management told me and the customers that they would be getting all new parts The parts that are from machines returned whether by customers or by shipping damage are reused as new and sold to new customers Management will send parts off to manufacturers for repairs without notifying the customers leaving their customers without their machines for MONTHS but say RMA repairs are done in 1820 business days You honestly dont even know if the parts are shipping back for repair In my experience less than 10 of RMA repairs actually hold for more than 60 days Conveniently they seem to always break again after the 60 day RMA return policy If a customers machine is delayed due to parts shortage Management didnt email any of the customers Instead customers would wait twice the time to ship out a machine Management told me to lie to customers about water reservoirs we received that had manufacturer defects so we wouldnt have to pay for shipping and RMA repairs due to recall Management constantly change the shipping times but still send out automated emails saying 1015 days When I brought this up to Management and that it needed to change again I was ignored This company is so sleazy theyll take an already build machine that was cancelled and sell it to someone else but charge them a 15 restock fee when the new customer also cancels We had over 30 cancellations just this week and they only build a bout a thousand machines a month Quality Assurance is virtually nonexistent 90 the builds are sent out defective and the assembly line is basically the machines pushed on a line roller while sitting on flimsy pieces of cardboard The pictures on here dont lie Im sure a lot of the issues people had with their machines are due to negligence by the assembly team knocking pcs over Youll deal with at least a dozen PCs damaged in shipping by UPS but even UPS is starting to question the damage Ive even seen them send an order to the wrong person multiple times and then offer the person extended warranties to cover it but dont bother compensating the person that is still waiting on their package Most tech tickets have MONTHS of note and no resolution The problem almost never gets resolved and if you send your machine in for RMA they over charge you RMA isnt a department  its Assembly people working a couple of hours here and there fixing machines theres a chance it will come back in worse condition than you sent it Ive seen them send customers hard drives installed but not formatted charged them for high dollar SSD drives and then install cheaper brands Theyve sent out defective keyboards and refused to refund them until I had the customer actually make a video of them turning it on to show it didnt work just to get the customer a refund They actually say the use quality Corsair ram as their name brand on the Configurator but a customer actually let me know theyre using cheap Patriot Ram Call backs from Remote Tech consist of quick and dirty fixes to get the customer off the phone as quickly as possible  they just dont want the phones to ring Communication between departments is virtually nonexistent and almost impossible get any info for the customers The backend is constantly going out the ticket system has server problems and the poor customers are stuck dealing with people that dont want to help them or take their calls I mean just last week their server was hacked by a bot and spammed over 5k in emails using the management email This company is so despised the majority of the emails that come to the management email which is the ONLY way to contact them by the way is porn You heard that right Upset customers and probably employees spammed the management email with porn The owner actually threatened me with a lawsuit for demanding a refund on the defective equipment they sent me from the very beginning as well as a severance package letting him know that I knew the truth had proof and would let everyone know of their deceptive business practices He then reminded me that I might one day need a reference from the company so I should be happy to send the equipment first and they would cut me a check It took me 5 months to get a customer reimbursed for their laptop that was stolen by UPS Had it not been for me Digital Storm wouldnt have gotten involved and another employee actually told the customer to say it was stolen out of his car to get reimbursed But they expect me to send them the equipment and wait for a check If you check reviews on Yelp youll see the truth Check their forums and facebook though and you see nothing but ZOMG Theyre awesome

183,Notrelated,They either have the most inefficient payroll department a money issue or just keep the funds for themselves as long as possible Its not rocket science its really very basic math salary bank holidays holidays and hours offflexihours Its like KS payroll department doesnt even know basic maths Im sure that the capital is no issue as you have contract agreements with quite wealthy companies and you just seem to withhold on peoples salaries Your excuses are often but its only X amount or we use a very old system and it can lead to mistakes or the data is input by people and they make mistakes etc First of all it DOES NOT matter how much the amount is even if it was one pound or one pence youve NO RIGHT to mess up with peoples salaries this badly Secondly you said many times that the software used for payroll is old how old exactly are we talking here Like form the Victorian era If youre really using a very old system dont you think its about time to upgrade to a more sophisticated software Additionally since when the salary for flexihours is different than the hourly rate Like they actually come up with a calculation based on things that were never told at any time if this would be the case then make it CLEAR from the beginning and not after months when one has already started their job Again by law it has to be the same rate and not a rate made up with the explanation of the rate for flexihours is according to what youve worked so far Also DO NOT dare to say that you cant afford a new software at the moment since theyre too pricey otherwise Id be Ghandi Some of your clients are quite the golden goose and I highly doubt that they give you crumbs as payment Every single week there was a payment issue inaccurate payment or no payment at all and I mean every week and it wasnt like 1 or 2 people who experienced issues like these but like half of the staff or more had issues with either salary or holiday pay or both were talking here about 1520 out of 30 or 40 Two or three people with payment issues are a coincidence over half a dozen are a pattern The sums can vary from small amounts to a whole weeks pay and the chasing can go on for weeks even months In addition over the course they came up with things like employee of the month and gift them with a 50 voucher which later on was changed to a 25 voucher refer a friend scheme free donuts do something for the people on their birthdays etc This is all good and that but why not invest all that time effort energy resources and money in paying the people properly first and then maybe do things like these and not just distract their attention toward something else in the hopes they wont think too much about the salaryholiday pay issues For example how about a weekly reminder to the employees to submit their timesheet Because otherwise people have to wait 2 weeks for their payment Is it really too much to set up a reminder I do it at my job and you can either program it or just copy paste the message and it doesnt even take 5 minutes We dont live in an era were food or free accommodation andor other items were given as payment in exchange for work trying to buy people with food has already become quite pass not to mention that its always food thats not healthy at all like cheap donuts Also some people are on their own or single parents and dont have anyone to back them up others have deadlines for payments rent bills mortgage etc and some even have to send money which isnt done instantly and people have to prepare and plan when the money needs to go out some even have children for Petes sake This is an extremely serious issue This reason alone made working for KS tremendously tedious having to worry weekly and wondering will I get paid correctly this week or how much money will I be missing this week is a nuisance Now to the matter of taxes its common knowledge that if your weekly or monthly salary changes all the time like if it goes up and down like a yoyo so do the taxes you pay but according to KS this is not true Are you serious I was told like twice that even if your weekly salary changes a bit your taxes dont change Im not even going to bother to fully write this one out Furthermore how dare you to tell your employees that they have no right to contact KS payroll department directly for payroll related issues or questions Theres no rule or law that forbids us to contact them It was quite weird that whenever I requested their phone number I was always dismissed informing me KS will take care of it and discuss it with payroll I can discuss the matter with payroll and probably would be better off doing so because Im the one who has been affected and knows more about the current matter at hand not KS In terms of employees records keeping when I contacted KS twice regarding my P45 I was told and reassured that it was already sent out to me and therefore also to HMRC However I knew it was a lie because I called HMRC right afterward and they had no record of it on their system and they always receive it first because once its submitted it goes straight to them I asked KS why not send a softcopy to me via email and a hardcopy via post I was told that it wasnt possible to do this because by law KS is not allowed to send this type of documents via email and secondly KS doesnt keep any records of their employees Firstly since June 2015 the law has changed and any company or agency can send employees P45 via email to speed things up and send a hardcopy via post just google HMRC Employer Bulletin June 2015 Issue 54 page 2 and it states clearly there Secondly by law agencies payroll have to keep records of all employees for 3 years google GOV paye for employers keeping records for further information so just for this last point youre clearly breaking the law It is in our right to be paid properly and on time and by law even Furthermore we DO NOT have to apologise for taking up your time or bothering you much less to go after you every single week Is it possible that KS somehow twist peoples minds so much that people apologise for their mistake and taking up their time seriously One can be polite and respectful but DO NOT have to apologise for your mistake and dont come to me saying that theyre being nice thats not being nice its being foolish particularly when they havent paid you correctly or not paid at all It is KS job and their payroll department to pay the people accordingly and on time and if you think that all your employees are all sheep and wouldnt write a real honest review then think again Peace out PS To the people at a certain large company grow a backbone or forever hold your peace Its extremely annoying hearing people constantly complaining and whining like big babies but not actually having the courage to even speak up directly and facetoface to Kelly Services about the issues theyre having with them
